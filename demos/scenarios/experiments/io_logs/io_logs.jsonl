For example, simple arithmetic or algebraic problems (like solving for *x* or multiplying unit costs) don\u2019t require explicit \"validation\" or \"method justification\" steps, as these are inherently obvious to capable agents. This can lead to redundant or forced explanations.  \n<END>  \n\n<START>  \n2. **Ambiguity in Step Granularity:**  \n   The instruction doesn\u2019t clarify how detailed each step should be. For instance, in the circumference problem, the agent combines two calculations (2 \u00d7 3.14 and 6.28 \u00d7 7) into one step, while the instruction implies breaking every operation into separate steps. This mismatch can confuse agents about the expected level of detail.  \n<END>  \n\n<START>  \n3. **Redundant Validation for Simple Problems:**  \n   The instruction mandates validation for every solution, but for straightforward problems (e.g., \"2x - 5 = 11\"), validation is trivial and adds noise. Capable agents might skip or rush this step, leading to inconsistencies.  \n<END>  \n\n<START>  \n4. **Formatting Rigidity:**  \n   The `<ANS_START>...<ANS_END>` format is strictly enforced, but the instruction doesn\u2019t specify how to handle multi-part answers (e.g., the consecutive integers problem). Agents might struggle with formatting composite answers (e.g., \"14, 15, 16\") or units (e.g., \"mph\").  \n<END>  \n\n<START>  \n5. **Assumption Handling Overkill:**  \n   The instruction asks agents to \"state assumptions explicitly,\" but many problems (e.g., speed calculations) rely on universally accepted assumptions (e.g., constant speed). Forcing agents to declare these can feel unnatural and waste tokens.  \n<END>  \n\n<START>  \n6. **Lack of Problem-Type Adaptation:**  \n   The instruction doesn\u2019t differentiate between problem categories (algebra, geometry, arithmetic). A one-size-fits-all approach may not optimize for domain-specific nuances (e.g., algebraic manipulation vs. unit conversions).  \n<END>  \n\n### Suggested Improvements:  \n- **Flexible Step Emphasis:** Allow agents to skip or merge steps (e.g., validation) for trivial problems.  \n- **Clarify Detail Level:** Specify whether to break down every arithmetic operation or combine logical chunks.  \n- **Adapt to Problem Type:** Add conditional logic (e.g., \"For algebraic equations, focus on isolating the variable\").  \n- **Simplify Formatting Rules:** Permit relaxed formatting for multi-part answers or units.  \n\nExample revision:  \n*\"Solve the problem concisely.

How much do 12 apples cost?\"  \n**Answer**: Too simple; lacks real-world nuance.  \n\n**Improvements**:  \n- **Add Discounts/Tax**: E.g., \"Apples cost $0.75 each, but there's a 10% discount for 12 apples. What is the total cost?\"  \n- **Bulk Pricing**: E.g., \"12 apples cost $9.00, but 24 apples cost $16.00. What is the cheaper per-apple price?\"  \n\n**Revised Example**:  \n[Question] A store sells apples at $0.80 each but offers 15% off for a dozen. How much do 12 apples cost?  \n[Answer] 1. Original cost = 12 \u00d7 $0.80 = $9.60.  \n2. Discount = 15% of $9.60 = $1.44.  \n3. Final cost = $9.60 - $1.44 = $8.16.  \n`<ANS_START>$8.16<ANS_END>`\n\n---\n\n### **5. Current Example: Consecutive Integers (Algebra/Word Problem)**\n**Problem**: \"The sum of three consecutive integers is 45.

Find the numbers.\"  \n\n**Revised Example**:  \n[Question] The sum of three consecutive odd integers is 57. Find the integers.  \n[Answer] 1. Let integers be x, x+2, x+4.  \n2.

Consecutive odd integers are odd numbers that follow each other in order, differing by 2 (e.g., 5, 7, 9).\n\n2. **Define Variables**: Let the first odd integer be \\( x \\). Since the integers are consecutive and odd, the next two integers will be \\( x + 2 \\) and \\( x + 4 \\).\n\n3. **Set Up the Equation**: The sum of the three integers is 57. Therefore, the equation is:\n   \\[\n   x + (x + 2) + (x + 4) = 57\n   \\]\n\n4. **Simplify the Equation**: Combine like terms:\n   \\[\n   3x + 6 = 57\n   \\]\n\n5. **Solve for \\( x \\)**: \n   - Subtract 6 from both sides:\n     \\[\n     3x = 51\n     \\]\n   - Divide both sides by 3:\n     \\[\n     x = 17\n     \\]\n\n6. **Find the Consecutive Integers**: \n   - First integer: \\( x = 17 \\)\n   - Second integer: \\( x + 2 = 19 \\)\n   - Third integer: \\( x + 4 = 21 \\)\n\n7. **Verify the Solution**: \n   - Sum of the integers: \\( 17 + 19 + 21 = 57 \\), which matches the given condition.\n\n8. **Present the Answer**: The three consecutive odd integers are 17, 19, and 21.\n   `<ANS_START>17, 19, 21<ANS_END>`", "meta": {"execution_time_sec": 17.61394214630127, "timestamp": "2025-05-19 16:08:36.925435", "method_name": "chat_completion"}, "id": "24f18ab2-9d9d-496d-a836-b149c4a662d9"}
